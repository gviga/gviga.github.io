I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/), working at the intersection of **machine learning**, **geometric data processing**, and **computer graphics**. 

My work focuses on developing neural architectures to understand and model maps between 3D shapes. I am passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance computational reasoning in geometry. 

Previously, I earned a Master‚Äôs degree in *Applied Mathematics* with honors and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in *Mathematics* from the University of Milan. During my studies, I spent an exchange semester at the University of Twente.

### Research Interests
- Geometric Deep Learning
